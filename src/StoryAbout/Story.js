                India is a land of many colors and flavors, and South Indian
                cuisine is the term used to collectively refer to flavors from
                Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Karnataka. What makes
                South Indian food so distinct from the other Indian cuisines is
                its use of coconut,lentils and local vegetables like tamarind,
                snake gourd, plantain and ginger. Also you will notice the
                refreshing freshness, and lightness of the food – nourish
                yourself with fresh,wholesome food that isn’t too heavy on the
